# Privacy Policy


This Privacy Policy describes how IA Scanner ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). 

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### 1. Our Commitment to Privacy

At IA Scanner, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We design our services with a fundamental principle: we process only the information necessary to provide you with a full-featured scanning and PDF editing experience, and we minimize data collection wherever possible.

### 2. Information We Collect and Process

To provide our core functionality, the App requires access to certain features on your device. The information involved can be categorized as follows:

#### A. Personal Information You Provide Directly
*   **Document and Image Content:** When you use the App to scan documents or create PDFs from images, you grant us access to your device's camera and photo library. The images and documents you process are stored locally on your device and/or your personal iCloud storage. **We do not upload, store, or have access to the content of your documents or images on our servers.** This data remains under your control at all times.

#### B. Information Collected Automatically
*   **Usage Data:** To help us improve the App, we may collect non-personal, aggregated information about how you use our services. This may include data such as feature usage frequency, session length, and crash reports. This information does not identify you personally.
*   **Device Information:** We may collect generic information about your device, such as the device type, operating system version, and language settings. This helps us ensure compatibility and optimize performance.

#### C. Payment Information
All purchases are processed directly by the Apple App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your credit/debit card information or Apple ID credentials. Your payment transactions are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

### 3. Legal Basis for Processing (For EEA Users)
We process your information based on the following legal grounds:
*   **Performance of a Contract:** Processing your documents and images is necessary to provide the scanning and PDF editing services you request.
*   **Legitimate Interests:** We use usage and device data to maintain, improve, and develop our App, which is in our legitimate business interest.
*   **Consent:** For specific features that require permissions (like Camera and Photo Library), your consent is obtained through your device's permission system.

### 4. Permissions We Request

The App requests the following permissions on your device to function fully:
*   **Camera:** To capture images of documents for scanning.
*   **iCloud Storage:** To enable you to back up and sync your created PDFs across your Apple devices.

You can manage these permissions at any time via your device's "Settings > Privacy & Security" menu. Denying a permission will disable the related feature but will not affect the functionality of other parts of the App.

### 5. How We Use Your Information
*   **To Provide Services:** To enable document scanning, PDF creation, editing, and iCloud synchronization.
*   **To Improve Our App:** To analyze aggregated usage data to fix bugs, enhance performance, and develop new features.
*   **For Customer Support:** To respond to your inquiries and provide support.

### 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data to third parties. We may share non-personal, aggregated data with third-party service providers (such as analytics tools like Google Firebase) to help us improve the App. These partners are bound by contracts that require them to protect your data.

### 7. Data Retention and Deletion
Your documents and PDFs are stored locally on your device and your personal iCloud account. You can delete them at any time through the App or by managing your iCloud storage. Aggregated usage data is retained only for as long as necessary for analytical purposes.

### 8. Data Security
We implement industry-standard security measures designed to protect any information we process. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### 9. Your Rights (CCPA/CPRA, GDPR)
Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict its processing. To exercise these rights, please contact us at ia.help@outlook.com.

### 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
